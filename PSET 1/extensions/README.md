Implement a program that prompts the user for the name of a file and then outputs that file’s media type if the file’s name ends, case-insensitively, in any of these suffixes:

.gif
.jpg
.jpeg
.png
.pdf
.txt
.zip

If the file’s name ends with some other suffix or has no suffix at all, output application/octet-stream instead, which is a common default.
