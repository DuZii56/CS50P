Implement a program that prompts the user for a greeting. If the greeting starts with “hello”, output $0. If the greeting starts with an “h” (but not “hello”), output $20. Otherwise, output $100. Ignore any leading whitespace in the user’s greeting, and treat the user’s greeting case-insensitively.
