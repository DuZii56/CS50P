Implement two functions:

dollars_to_float, which should accept a str as input (formatted as "$##.##", wherein each # is a decimal digit), remove the leading $, and return the amount as a float. For instance, given $50.00 as input, it should return 50.0.
percent_to_float, which should accept a str as input (formatted as "##%", wherein each # is a decimal digit), remove the trailing %, and return the percentage as a float. For instance, given 15% as input, it should return 0.15.
Assume that the user will input values in the expected formats.
