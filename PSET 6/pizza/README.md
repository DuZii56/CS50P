Implement a program that expects exactly one command-line argument, the name (or path) of a CSV file in Pinocchio’s format, and outputs a table formatted as ASCII art using tabulate, a package on PyPI at pypi.org/project/tabulate. Format the table using the library’s grid format. If the user does not specify exactly one command-line argument, or if the specified file’s name does not end in .csv, or if the specified file does not exist, the program should instead exit via sys.exit.
