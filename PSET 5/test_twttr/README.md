Reimplement Setting up my twttr from Problem Set 2, restructuring your code wherein shorten expects a str as input and returns that same str but with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted, whether inputted in uppercase or lowercase.

Then, in a file called test_twttr.py, implement one or more functions that collectively test your implementation of shorten thoroughly, each of whose names should begin with test_.
