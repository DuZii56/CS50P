Reimplement Vanity Plates from Problem Set 2, restructuring your code, wherein is_valid still expects a str as input and returns True if that str meets all requirements and False if it does not, but main is only called if the value of __name__ is "__main__".

Then, in a file called test_plates.py, implement four or more functions that collectively test your implementation of is_valid thoroughly, each of whose names should begin with test_.
