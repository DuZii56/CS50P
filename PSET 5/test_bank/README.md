Reimplement Home Federal Savings Bank from Problem Set 1, restructuring your code, wherein value expects a str as input and returns 0 if that str starts with “hello”, 20 if that str starts with an “h” (but not “hello”), or 100 otherwise, treating the str case-insensitively. You can assume that the string passed to the value function will not contain any leading spaces. Only main should call print.

Then, in a file called test_bank.py, implement three or more functions that collectively test your implementation of value thoroughly, each of whose names should begin with test_.
