Implement a program that:

Expects the user to specify as a command-line argument the number of Bitcoins, n, that they would like to buy. If that argument cannot be converted to a float, the program should exit via sys.exit with an error message.

Queries the API for the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index at https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json, which returns a JSON object, among whose nested keys is the current price of Bitcoin as a float. Be sure to catch any exceptions.

Outputs the current cost of n Bitcoins in USD to four decimal places, using , as a thousands separator.
